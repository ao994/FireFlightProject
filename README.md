# FireFlight
This is the repository for FireFlight, a Northern Arizona University Computer Science Senior Capstone Project developed from Fall 2024 to Spring 2025.

[You can visit our team website here](https://sce.nau.edu/capstone/projects/CS/2025/FireFlight_F24/index.html).

## Project Description
We have built a web application that allows the predicted bird presence data that our clients have calculated to be easily displayed and exported. It is displayed as an interactive heatmap, and can be exported as a CSV file and PNG based on the selected birds.

## Installation instructions
Installation instructions can be found on our Github Wiki, [linked here](https://github.com/ao994/FireFlightProject/wiki).
